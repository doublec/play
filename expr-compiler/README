Expression Evaluator using Pegs and Nanojit
===========================================

This builds on the expression evaluator in the 'expr-interpreter'
directory. Instead of interpreting the abstract syntax tree of the
expression it compiles it to machine code and calls the machine code
to get the result.

The compilation to machine code uses the Nanojit library. This is
included as a submodule in the 'thirdparty/nanojit' directory. The
library was originally by Adobe. It is used in their Tamarin
ActionScript VM and by Mozilla for their JavaScript JIT.
